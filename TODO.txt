TODO:

Find out how .pc jbeam part displays the node names

* load quads
* when all selected, selected all instances
* search by name with "" should work

BUGS:

Ctrl+Z not working when saving jbeam props, even though we use bl_options UNDO

Loading Jbeam Bugs:
C:\Users\hkunz\Documents\BeamNG.drive\editable_vehicles\vehicles\cargotrailer\cargotrailer_woodplanks_short.jbeam > Claims to have missing node but actually is a limitation in addon, since the missing nodes are in another base jbeam file
C:\Users\hkunz\Documents\BeamNG.drive\editable_vehicles\vehicles\cargotrailer\cargotrailer.jbeam > bpy.data.objects['cargotrailer_cargotrailer']: Index 1111 out of range in Object Mode (edges)
C:\Users\hkunz\Documents\BeamNG.drive\editable_vehicles\vehicles\caravan\caravan.jbeam > Exception

Export Bugs:
When exporting jbeam without any scope modifiers, the beams and triangles dont get exported
Cannot export/overwrite a file's nodes/beams/triangles if there are syntax problems

TASKS:

Load Quads https://documentation.beamng.com/modding/vehicle/sections/triangles/quads/ A quad with nodes n1, n2, n3, n4 will create 2 triangles with the nodes n1, n2, n3 and n3, n4, n1 respectively. Even though there is no technical disadvantage of using them, they make it somewhat harder to understand the Jbeam files
