TODO:

Find out how .pc jbeam part displays the node names
Detect overlapping vertices and mark node in red
Add function to search a node by id
support overlapping nodes
support multiple beams/triangle instances
on_save event, save the jbeam_props_storage.py data into object.data as custom serialized json

* check on export if not duplicate RefNodes stored caused by modeling
* when all selected, selected all instances
* search by name with "" should work
* jbeam load with specific scope modifiers

BUGS:

Ctrl+Z not working when saving jbeam props, even though we use bl_options UNDO
Cannot add 2nd instance to triangles
Cannot delete instance
Potential Face orientation problem when saving and loading again. Should not reorder NodeIDs in Beams & Tris
When importing mattress_full i cannot search a beam or triangle for some reason

Loading Jbeam Bugs:
C:\Users\hkunz\Documents\BeamNG.drive\editable_vehicles\vehicles\cargotrailer\cargotrailer_woodplanks_short.jbeam > Claims to have missing node but actually is a limitation in addon, since the missing nodes are in another base jbeam file
